# [Deprecated] Second State WebAssembly VM for Node.js Addon with native storage interface support

The [Second State VM (SSVM)](https://github.com/second-state/ssvm) is a high-performance WebAssembly runtime optimized for server-side applications. This project provides support for accessing SSVM as a Node.js addon. It allows Node.js applications to call WebAssembly functions written in Rust or other high-performance languages. [Why do you want to run WebAssembly on the server-side?](https://cloud.secondstate.io/server-side-webassembly/why) The SSVM addon could interact with the wasm files generated by the [ssvmup](https://github.com/second-state/ssvmup) compiler tool.


# This project is deprecated. If you want to use this feature, please try our new package [SSVM-Napi-Extensions](https://github.com/second-state/ssvm-napi-extensions) instead. Thanks.
